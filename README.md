====================

Sample AngularJS app.  GIT REST API calls with table sorting.  Based on Pluralsight course.

Click respective table header to sort by Name, Stars or Language.  Sort order is displayed above the table.  Changing the sort order does not result in a REST call.  The in memory model is resorted based on the selected header.
